## GNT-Market
Grocery Nutrient Tracker DB Web App
Main theme of this web app is to help users to get a convenient and healthy selection for the grocery list. Users can generate their grocery list by selecting a dish, which internally converts a dish to ingredient food items and/or by adding food items directly. User customized dietary restrictions and preferences are taken into consideration when generating a grocery list. This app also provides quantitative nutritional distribution for their grocery list as well as qualitative beneficial nutrient information for body systems.
